// This file (src/contexts/auth-context.tsx) is deprecated and no longer used.
// Core authentication (register/login) is handled by Firebase SDK calls in server actions.
// UI state related to login (e.g., in the header) is temporarily managed via localStorage
// and client-side state in the Header component.
// This file can be safely deleted.

// To prevent build errors if it's still imported somewhere (though it shouldn't be):
export {};
